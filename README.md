Welcome to the Multidex Project! My goal here is to collect reference data for first and second generation Pokémon ROM hacks in a simple MarkDown format.

* This repository is formatted for use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), just download the repository and open it with Obsidian and you'll have a comprehensive, local Pokémon ROM hack reference!
* Within the `/pokedex/` directory you'll find complete references with data on each Pokémon available, its Pokédex number, learnset, and where that Pokémon can be found.
* In the `/tm-index/` directory you can find references for the technical machine (TM) and hidden machine (HM) items available, which moves these machines teach and where they can be found.
